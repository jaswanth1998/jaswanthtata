  "professionalSummary": "Full-stack developer (5+ yrs) delivering microservices and web apps with Java/Spring Boot and Node.js. Shipped features that cut API latency ~40% and accelerated releases ~20% via CI/CD and observability. Built and operated services on public cloud (Azure/GCP), containerized with Docker, and enforced quality gates (Cypress, JUnit, SonarQube). Ready to apply this to AWS workloads (API Gateway, Lambda, S3, RDS/DynamoDB) to support secure, scalable migrations and serverless delivery.",
